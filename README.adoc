# OpenRewrite as a jbang script

As an experiment from asking https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions/834
I made this little script which is 97% same as the code found in https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-maven-plugin.

It lets you run OpenRewrite on any kind of project.

How to run: 

1. Install `jbang` (https://jbang.dev/download)
2. You can list recipes using:

[source,sh]
----
jbang rewrite@maxandersen/rewrite-jbang discover
----

3. Try run it with a few recipes: 

[source,sh]
----
jbang rewrite@maxandersen/rewrite-jbang --recipes org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup,org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat
----

You can also install the script using: `jbang app install  https://github.com/maxandersen/rewrite-jbang/blob/master/rewrite.java`
and just use `rewrite` directly, i.e.:

[source,sh]
----
rewrite --recipes org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup,org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat --dry-run
----

Limitations: 

* Does not (yet) offer to refer to dependencies
* Totally just slammed together code a slow sunday morning!
